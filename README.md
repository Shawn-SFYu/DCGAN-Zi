# DCGAN-Zi

![cgan training](./images/cgan.gif)

Implemented DCGAN, conditional-GAN for styled writing generation.

More compact neural networks are utilized here compared to other repos, [RestoreAe-Zi](https://github.com/Shawn-SFYu/RestoreAE-Zi) and [StyleVAE-Zi](https://github.com/Shawn-SFYu/StyleVAE-Zi), considering currently limited computation resources. Generators are implemented based on autoencoder and U-net structures. 

As one example, this pair of images shows changes in writing styles. The first image is standard writing, and the second image ...

The generated images ...

Example training configurations are listed in yaml files.
